Hi,

Welcome to MyPortfolio Github page! This Single-Page Application (SPA) Portfolio page is built using React.js (Hooks, Functional Components), Material UI (Grid System), and numerous other cool and unique features. In addition to my About, Projects, and Resume tabs, I have a Contact tab which is fully implemented with the front-end, however, still needs backend implementation (Express.Js) to get fully operational (Work-In-Progress). Enjoy!!
